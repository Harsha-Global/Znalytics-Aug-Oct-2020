2010:  AngularJS
2015 : Angular

Both goal:  To create single page apps (the page should never refresh)

AngularJS Expression (like interpolation binding in angular):
	{{expression}}

AngularJS Modules:
   - Building block of angular app
   - Collection of controllers, models, views, services, providers, factories, filters & directives.

MVC architecture:
	- Model: data
	- View:  html
	- Controller: JS code to pass model to view.

	1. Controller can call Model.
	2. Controller can call View.
	3. View can call Model.

AngularJS uses MVC architecture (a.k.a. design pattern).


model:


{
}
